**Resolved | Apr 08, 2021 | 07:55 GMT+01:00**\

Investigation has identified an element which we have modified to address the issue and this has resolved the issue.

Unity users with the issue should restart the Unity Client.

**Investigating - Apr 02, 2021 Â¦ 08:00 GMT**

We are currently investigating reports of some users being unable to login to the Unity application. The issue presents itself by the application hanging on "checking Broadworks version" on initial start up.
