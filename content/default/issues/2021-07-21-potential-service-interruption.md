**UPDATE: July 21 09:26**

We have been investigating logs and could see there was a network interruption this morning between 09:17 and 09:19. Service should have been operational from 09:19 again for the majority of users however we were seeing reports of some users not being able to login to some applications until around 09:43. We are continuing to investigate with our vendors and will provide a further update later today. Service should be operating as expected at the moment.
