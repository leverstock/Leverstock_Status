We are currently investigating issues affecting some third party applications including Unity Desktop and UC-One

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 15 - 09:30 GMT -**\
Our 3rd Line team have been working on this all weekend and are engaged with the top leve support from Cisco.  Currently the service is working and may not produce any difficulties today, however the team are working to confirm that the issue has been resolved.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 13 - 16:07 GMT -**\
Additional patching was carried out yesterday evening to address error logs which we believe to be related to this incident. As it stands, UC-One Trio is operating as normal and the error logs in question are no longer being generated. We are continuing to monitor the situation whilst we carry on with our overall investigation. 

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 12 - 22:30 GMT -**\
This evening we will be patching our XSP servers on further advice from Cisco, due to the issues experienced with UC-One Trio logins experienced on the 9th and 10th, and 12th of March 2021. 

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 12 - 11:19 GMT -**

Unfortunately we experienced a recurrence of this issue this morning between 10:15 and 10:24. This would suggest the patch which was applied was not successful in resolving the problem. We are continuing our investigation to try and get this resolved once and for all. Apologies for the inconvenience which may have been caused.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 11 - 08:59 GMT -**

Emergency maintenance was performed yesterday evening to resolve this issue after a new software patch was identified to be required. Service is currently stable and we'll continue to monitor the situation. A final update will be provided in due course when we close this incident down. Apologies for the inconvenience caused by this incident.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 10 - 13:51 GMT -**

The issue affecting UC-One Trio is no longer present and we are continuing to monitor the situation whilst we work with the third party supplier. A further update will be provided in due course.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 10 - 11:14 GMT -**

We believe this issue to only be affecting UC-One Trio. Our investigation continues as we liaise with the supplier.
