We are currently investigating issues affecting some third party applications including Unity Desktop and UC-One

<br>

**UPDATE - 11:14 GMT -**

We believe this issue to only be affecting UC-One Trio. Our investigation continues as we liaise with the supplier.

<br>

**UPDATE - 13:51 GMT -**

The issue affecting UC-One Trio is no longer present and we are continuing to monitor the situation whilst we work with the third party supplier. A further update will be provided in due course.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 11 - 08:59 GMT -**

Emergency maintenance was performed yesterday evening to resolve this issue after a new software patch was identified to be required. Service is currently stable and we'll continue to monitor the situation. A final update will be provided in due course when we close this incident down. Apologies for the inconvenience caused by this incident.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 12 - 11:19 GMT -**

Unfortunately we experienced a recurrence of this issue this morning between 10:15 and 10:24. This would suggest the patch which was applied was not successful in resolving the problem. We are continuing our investigation to try and get this resolved once and for all. Apologies for the inconvenience which may have been caused.
