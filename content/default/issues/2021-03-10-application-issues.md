We are currently investigating issues affecting some third party applications including Unity Desktop and UC-One

<br>

**RESOLVED - Mar 17 - 11:47 GMT -**\
We can confirm that in the last 24 hours we have not seen error logs and the system is operating as expected. We are now confident that the changes made on 15/03/2021 have resolved the issue.  Apologies for the inconvenience this incident may have caused. 

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 16 - 10:20 GMT -**\
Modifications were made yesterday evening during a maintenance window to address the continued error messages we were seeing related to UC-One Trio. We are confident that the modifications made yesterday have now resolved the issue and we haven't seen any errors since. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely and will provide a status update at 11:45 on 17/03/2021. 

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 15 - 10:12 GMT -**\
This incident remains active. Unfortunately there have been additional error logs generated on 14/03/2021 which are related to this issue. Various required changes, relating specifically to server side logging, have been identified which we believe will help in resolving the problem. That work is being planned at the moment and will be scheduled in as maintenance this evening. 

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 13 - 16:07 GMT -**\
Additional patching was carried out yesterday evening to address error logs which we believe to be related to this incident. As it stands, UC-One Trio is operating as normal and the error logs in question are no longer being generated. We are continuing to monitor the situation whilst we carry on with our overall investigation. 

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 12 - 22:30 GMT -**\
This evening we will be patching our XSP servers on further advice from Cisco, due to the issues experienced with UC-One Trio logins experienced on the 9th and 10th, and 12th of March 2021. 

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 12 - 11:19 GMT -**

Unfortunately we experienced a recurrence of this issue this morning between 10:15 and 10:24. This would suggest the patch which was applied was not successful in resolving the problem. We are continuing our investigation to try and get this resolved once and for all. Apologies for the inconvenience which may have been caused.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 11 - 08:59 GMT -**

Emergency maintenance was performed yesterday evening to resolve this issue after a new software patch was identified to be required. Service is currently stable and we'll continue to monitor the situation. A final update will be provided in due course when we close this incident down. Apologies for the inconvenience caused by this incident.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 10 - 13:51 GMT -**

The issue affecting UC-One Trio is no longer present and we are continuing to monitor the situation whilst we work with the third party supplier. A further update will be provided in due course.

<br>

**UPDATE - Mar 10 - 11:14 GMT -**

We believe this issue to only be affecting UC-One Trio. Our investigation continues as we liaise with the supplier.
