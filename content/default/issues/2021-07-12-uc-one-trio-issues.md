**UPDATE** 13, 2021 | 11:05 GMT+01:00
The maintenance work which was scheduled yesterday evening to address this issue was completed successfully. 
We have not seen any instances of the problem this morning and are continuing to monitor. 
We'll mark this incident as resolved once we've monitored the situation for 24 hours.

**ISSUE DETAILS**

We are still seeing intermittent issues affecting UC-One Trio. Users may be disconnected from the application and then be unable to log back in temporarily.

We believe the issue is due to resource constraints on a specific set of servers and are scheduling in emergency maintenance this evening to rectify the issue.

We'll continue to monitor the situation and provide a further update tomorrow morning. Apologies for the inconvenience this may be causing.
