We are still seeing intermittent issues affecting UC-One Trio. Users may be disconnected from the application and then be unable to log back in temporarily.

We believe the issue is due to resource constraints on a specific set of servers and are scheduling in emergency maintenance this evening to rectify the issue.

We'll continue to monitor the situation and provide a further update tomorrow morning. Apologies for the inconvenience this may be causing.
